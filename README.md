# Local Scour Prediction Model using XGBoost and SHAP
#
## Introduction

This repository contains code for a local scour prediction model that utilizes the XGBoost machine learning algorithm for prediction and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model analysis and interpretation. 
The model is designed to predict local scour around bridges based on various input parameters.
For a detailed explanation of the model, its implementation, and usage, please refer to the 'Local Scour Prediction Model.pdf'file included in this repository.

## Contents

- `local_scour_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the local scour prediction model.
- `inputdata.csv`: Sample input dataset containing input parameters for the model.
- `outputdata.csv`: Corresponding sample output dataset containing observed scour depth values.
- `regulation_renew.csv`: Sample dataset for model generalization and visualization.
- `README.md`: This readme file providing an overview of the repository.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

2. Open the `local_scour_prediction.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook using Jupyter or a compatible environment.
